# Yousif-QUT-Python-Project 
In this project I have used my python skills to create a program which specifies the summarise of using the python turtle graphics and from that project, I got the ideas on how to evaluate expressions, use pre-defined Functions, create re-usable code, make decision and repeating action using Python. so in this project i was required to design some building for city and the design required:
1. A series of stories or floors: the buildings  can be from 1 to 10 floors 
2. roof: Every building has a roof. 
This project had 2 parts : 
part a: creating the floors and the roof
part b: Creating the work in progress (the building is under construction)
